The aim of this project was to create a webpage which contains an interactive drawing field.
In order to use it, you simply need to press the left mouse button on the grey rectangle in the centre
of the webpage.
If you hold the button and move the mouse you can continually draw shapes which change colour depending
on where the mouse is.
If you let go of the mouse button and then press it again the colour scheme of the shapes will alternate
between two sets.

When developing this project I wanted to create something unique that could be used as a simple interactive
drawing tool in order to create weird patterns and designs. I went through multiple iterations of my project such as
having a basic shape stamping feature which would randomly generate shapes if the mouse button was pressed, however I decided
against this idea because it lacked control and it appeared too boring for the user. Following this I went through many other
versions of this project but I ended up rejecting most of them due to difficulties with coding and ultimately decided to create
something that I could comprehend.
